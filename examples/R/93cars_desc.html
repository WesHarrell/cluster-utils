<h2>  Abstract</h2>      
<p>     The 93CARS dataset contains information on 93 new          cars
for the 1993 model year.  Measures given          include price, mpg
ratings, engine size, body size,          and indicators of features. 
The 26 variables in          the dataset offer sufficient variety to
illustrate          a broad range of statistical techniques typically   
      found in introductory courses.</p>                        
<h1>      1.  Introduction</h1> 
<p>1    The 1993 New Car data was inspired by a similar dataset for    
 1989 model cars which has been included among the sample      data for
the<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html#execustat"> <cite> Student Edition of Execustat</cite></a>
 (PWS-KENT 1990).      We have used <cite>Execustat</cite>'s  CARS89
data to demonstrate many      points in both introductory and second
level courses in      applied statistics.  In what follows we give a
brief      description of the updated and expanded 93CARS dataset and   
  suggest several ways it might be used in class.  
</p>                        
<h1>   2.  Data Sources
</h1> 
<p>2    Data were obtained from two sources,  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html#consumer"><cite>
The 1993 Cars - Annual      Auto Issue</cite></a>  from  <cite>Consumer
Reports</cite>   and the  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html#pace"><cite>PACE New Car &amp;     
Truck 1993 Buying Guide </cite></a>.  Passenger cars or vans that were  
   included in both sources were eligible for selection.  A      random
sample of models given in the
<cite> PACE Buying Guide </cite> was      chosen and matched to cars
covered in the <cite> Consumer      Reports</cite>  issue until a
desired sample size of 93 was      reached.  Vehicles in the Pickup
Truck and Sport/Utility      category were excluded due to incomplete
information in the       <cite>Consumer Reports  </cite>article.  We
also avoided multiple      inclusions of cars which were essentially the
same model      (such as the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance).
</p>                       
<h1> 3.  Description of the Data</h1> 
<p>3    Each data case starts with the MANUFACTURER (e.g.,     
Chevrolet, Audi, Honda,...), MODEL (e.g., Caprice, 90,      Accord,...),
and a TYPE (Small, Sporty, Compact, Midsize,      Large, Van).  The
types were determined by the  <cite>Consumer      Reports</cite> 
classifications.  The other 23 variables are all      numeric.  Three
PRICE variables give a "minimum" cost for a      basic model, a
"maximum" for a model equipped with lots of      options, and a
"midrange" as the average of the two      extremes.  The EPA fuel
efficiency ratings are given as both      CITY and HIGHWAY miles per
gallon (MPG).
</p>
<p>4    Several measures reflect relative size and power of the     
standard engine.  These include the number of CYLINDERS,      engine
displacement SIZE (in liters), maximum HORSEPOWER,      and the
revolutions per minute (RPM) at which the maximum      power is
achieved.  A measure that might be less familiar to      most students
is the number of REVOLUTIONS of the engine      needed for the car to
travel one mile in its highest gear      (automatic transmission).
</p>
<p>5    Indications of each car's size are the LENGTH, WIDTH,     
WHEELBASE, U-TURN diameter, REAR seat room, LUGGAGE      capacity, and
size of the FUEL tank.  Car weights differed      somewhat between the
two data sources.  We used the WEIGHT      given by  <cite>Consumer
Reports</cite>  which included a full gas tank      and
air-conditioning, if available.
</p>
<p>6    Other variables note the presence of standard AIR BAGS     
(driver or passenger), the type of DRIVETRAIN (front-wheel,     
rear-wheel, or all-wheel), and an option for a MANUAL      transmission.
 A final variable categorizes the manufacturer      as domestic (U.S.)
or foreign, although this distinction is      becoming less and less
clear.
</p>
<p>7    The only missing values are for CYLINDERS in the rotary     
engine Mazda RX-7, REAR SEAT room for the two-seaters      (Corvette and
RX-7), and LUGGAGE capacity for the vans and      two-seaters.
</p>
<p> 8    A detailed key to the variables in the file can be found in   
   the <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html#appendix">Appendix </a>and the 
   
<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/93cars.txt">93cars.txt</a> file   
   which

<h1> 4.  Pedagogical Uses</h1> 
<p> 9    This is a multi-purpose dataset which can be used at many     
 points in a course.  We have often used <cite> Execustat</cite>'s 
similar        CARS89 data as an initial example for demonstrating the  
    statistical package to students in the second week of an      
introductory course.  This class typically is held in a        classroom
equipped with a computer and projection system,        with the
instructor "driving" the software.  Despite having        only studied
some descriptive techniques, students are easily       drawn into a
discussion of the interesting features of the        data.  They tend to
be familiar with most of the variables        (and specific car models).
 They anticipate relationships        between the variables, are quick
to generate both questions        and explanations, and enjoy guessing
at the identity of        outliers in the plots.  Inevitably, the class
period ends        long before the stream of questions is exhausted.
</p>
<p>10    In addition to numerous good numeric variables, the data      
provide several interesting options for dividing cars into      
different comparison groups (e.g., by DOMESTIC, TYPE,       AIRBAGS,
DRIVETRAIN, or MANUAL transmission).  Most of our       early analyses
use only basic summary statistics or       graphics, yet a discussion of
side-by-side boxplots of       highway MPG for domestic vs. foreign
manufacturers lays a       good foundation for later, more formal, work
on testing       hypotheses.  As those techniques are subsequently
developed,       we can continue to come back to the car data --
establishing       a familiar thread that can run throughout the course.
 We       don't always have to be "on-line" in a computer session to    
  use the data.  Often a few summary statistics may be all       that
are required to motivate an example.  Students can also       be
encouraged to do their own independent explorations.
</p>
<p>11    As one might expect, there are numerous relationships among   
   the variables which provide excellent examples for       discussing
scatterplots, correlation, and regression       techniques.  One can
easily find pairs of variables which       demonstrate strong or weak,
positive or negative       associations.  PRICE and MPG variables tend
to be popular       choices as "dependent" variables in studying
regression       models, although students need to exhibit some care in 
     approaching multiple regression situations since many of the      
potential predictors are often highly correlated among       themselves.
</p>
<p>12    We conclude by suggesting some specific ways the data may be  
    used to illustrate certain topics.  A little time spent      
exploring the data will quickly stimulate additional      
possibilities.
</p> 
<p>13    <em>Box-whisker plot</em>:  PRICE or MPG variables give good 
         examples of somewhat skewed data with potential          
outliers among the upper fences.
</p>
<p>14  <em>  Small sample confidence interval for a mean</em>:  Look
at HPW           or RPM within one TYPE of car.  Different students may 
         be assigned different TYPEs.
</p>
<p>15    <em>Difference in means between two independent samples</em>:
          Compare PRICE levels between DOMESTIC and FOREIGN cars.       
   Also watch out for significant differences in the           variances
between these two groups.
</p>
<p>16    <em>One-way ANOVA for difference in means</em>:  Check out
city MPG           ratings between the three DRIVETRAIN categories.
</p>
<p>17   <em> Contingency table</em>:  Construct and analyze a two-way
table           of AIRBAGS by FOREIGN/DOMESTIC.
</p>
<p>18   <em> Scatterplot</em>:  Plot PRICE by MPG.  Identify any
unusual           points.
</p>
<p>19    <em>Regression/correlation</em>:  REVOLUTIONS per mile tends
to be a           less familiar variable to the students.  Investigate  
        relationships and/or build models for REVOLUTIONS based         
 on a restricted subset of other engine or body size          
variables.
</p>
<p>20   <em> An exam question</em>:  Provide computer output for      
    investigating the relationship between number of           CYLINDERS
and MPG using only 4, 6, and 8 cylinder cars.           Have students
interpret the results of both a one-way           ANOVA and a simple
linear regression.  Which approach           is more appropriate?
